      title: 'Crispy Yellow Fried Chicken',
      description: """
        Another variant of Javanese Fried Chicken: Ayam Goreng Bumbu Kuning, one of my family's favourite side dish!! Kuning means yellow. The name already suggest that this dish is dominated by yellow colour which comes from turmeric. You can find this fried chicken all the way along Java Island.
        Spice may be varies slightly from region to region but the main ingredient as I mentioned above, turmeric is always present. What about the taste?? Hmmmâ€¦.it's finger licking good ðŸ˜‰ Crispy & yummy!!.
        Tip: Cut the chicken into a smaller serving portions to ensure that the spice mixture is well absorbed & the chicken will be crunchy on the outside.

    title: 'Nasi Goreng',
    description: """
    Important Note: I should warn you that dried shrimp paste smells quite awful especially for Europeans, but the taste in Nasi Goreng or other finished dishes (if required) is greatfully aromatic and essential to the authenticity of Indonesian cuisine. My suggestion, use it only little at first as I write in this recipe. It is less than in my Indonesian version.
    If preferred you can add shrimps or vegetables into your Nasi Goreng such as: beansprouts, peas or shredded carrots.
    If you are curious of another variant of Indonesian Nasi Goreng with fried achovies, please look at my "Nasi Goreng Teri/Ikan Bilis" recipe.

      There are many different varieties of Indonesian fish dishes. Each is special and unique!!!. Now I introduce you a deep fried fish dish with Sambal Matah, a famous chilli relish from Balinese people. This is a simply recipe but the taste hmmmmâ€¦spicy but delicious!!! Especially for you.. chilli lovers ðŸ™‚
      The secret for making delicious "Sambal Matah" is the right amount of dried shrimp paste & salt (It shall taste a bit salty) and of course by using fresh & raw ingredients includes raw garlic :-).
      Tips: If you're worry about garlic breath, just chew raw celery knob/root soon after eating any meal that contains a lot of garlic. The smell will disappear quickly ðŸ™‚
      Important Note: I should warn you that dried shrimp paste/terasi smells quite awful especially for Europeans, but dried shrimp paste is an essential ingredient for the authenticity as well as the best taste of Sambal Matah.
